# Dijkstra's Algorithm using an Adjacency list
Dijkstra's algorithm is used to traverse the graph that we create and find the shortest path possible throughout the
vertices. It uses breadth first search to iterate through each node while checking its adjacent nodes.


## Getting Started
There is a test file that will check to see if the algorithm implemented is correct and gives us the quickest path. The graph file contains the algorithm along with the creation with the graph.

## Running it
To compile the graph implementation of the algorithm, simply run `g++ -std=c++17 -Wall *.cpp ` and this will recompile the files.

To run the catch file and see the tests, simply run `./a.out`, which will show you all of the tests passed that were made in the PP5Test.cpp file.
